# In the beginning, there was command line. (Lets not talk about Bash...)
# Then, there was PowerShell...


# PowerShell massively simplifies automation and administration activities,
# turning laborious, repetitive tasks into schedule-friendly scripts.

# With a range of cmdlets and function libraries, there are PowerShell solutions
# to help in a variety of tasks from file admin to SQL Server

# To use this code, use F5 to run an entire script or F8 to run a highlighted code
# clear the PowerShell window with "cls" or Clear-Host.
# Use PowerShell ISE or VSCode with the PowerShell extension

# Try to stick to the full versions of cmdlets/functions for readability.

# Create a directory
mkdir "PowerShell Tips 'n' Tricks"

# Change directory, same as "cd"
Set-Location ".\PowerShell Tips n Tricks" 

# Open the folder Windows aka ii .
Invoke-Item .
